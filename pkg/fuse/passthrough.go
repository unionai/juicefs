// passthroughState manages per-open backing files used for FUSE passthrough
// write acceleration. EXPERIMENTAL: scoped to the write path. A file opened
// for write gets a local staging file (on a non-stacked fs) that the kernel
// reads/writes directly via FUSE_PASSTHROUGH, bypassing the daemon per-op. On
// release the staging file is reconciled into JuiceFS slices via the normal
// writer path. Durability is therefore deferred to release (commit-style),
// with one exception: fsync(2)/fdatasync(2) reconcile immediately (see
// fsync below), so an application's explicit sync point means what it says.
//
// Backing registrations are NOT reused across opens: each write-open gets a
// fresh registration (a new ioctl or, on unprivileged broker mounts, a new
// RPC round trip to the node broker, plus a fresh staging-file create), and
// reconcile() unregisters and removes it — for a DIFFERENT inode's next open,
// never the same one. This was originally pooled (checked-in backings parked
// for reuse by whichever inode opened next), which is measurably cheaper for
// small-file-heavy workloads, but pooling handed a backing file across
// inodes: once mmap(2) has been called on a passthrough fd, the kernel's
// fuse_passthrough_mmap() repoints the VMA directly at the backing file
// (vma_set_file), fully decoupling the mapping's lifetime from the fd — a
// process can close(2) (triggering reconcile+recycle) while a still-live,
// still-dirty mapping keeps writing to what is now, after recycling, a
// DIFFERENT inode's staging file. There is no FUSE opcode or other userspace
// signal that observes mmap activity on a passthrough-diverted file (the
// entire point of passthrough is to bypass such upcalls), so there is no way
// to detect "this backing might still be mmap'd" and only pool the ones that
// aren't. Reusing a backing across inodes is a real, silent cross-tenant
// data-corruption vector; not reusing it is not.
